Effect of Wells in Oklahoma

Team : Hocine, Tommy and Saurav

Proposal 

We are going to perform geo-mapping  of active wells (May, 2019) in Oklahoma and classifying them according to:
a)	County 
b)	Well Type (Disposal, Injection, Gas-storage and Production & Injection)
c)	Production amount.

Further Analyses  - Other variables, Pie charts, Bar charts (??) Hocine add here something

We are also going to look at Earthquakes in Oklahoma from the period 2008-2019. We will geo-locate the Earthquakes and create a time-series animation. Also, we are going to investigate if the magnitude or frequency of the earthquakes is dependent upon
a)	Production 
b)	Number of injection wells
c)	Date of activation of the well

Well Information: Oklahoma Corporation Commission,Oil and Gas Division (http://www.occeweb.com/og/ogdatafiles2.htm)


Earthquake Data : Oklahoma Geological Survey at University of Oklahoma (http://www.ou.edu/ogs/research/earthquakes/catalogs)

Design: 
Csv files will be imported to create a SQL database. Data will be retrieved Flask-Python interface. Visualizations will be created using Plotly, D3.js and relevant JS libraries.
